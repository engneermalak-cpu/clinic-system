/* CSS for Mobile Tooltips - v2 with transitions */

/* Style for the tooltip itself */
.mobile-tooltip-custom {
    position: absolute; /* Positioned by JavaScript */
    background-color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 0.95); /* Dark background, slightly transparent */
    color: #fff; /* White text */
    padding: 8px 12px;
    border-radius: 6px;
    font-size: 13px; /* Slightly smaller font for tooltips */
    line-height: 1.4;
    z-index: 10000; /* Ensure it's on top of other elements */
    box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);
    text-align: center;
    max-width: 220px; /* Prevent very wide tooltips */
    opacity: 0; /* Initially hidden for fade-in effect */
    visibility: hidden; /* Initially hidden */
    transition: opacity 0.3s ease, visibility 0.3s ease; /* Smooth fade-in/out */
    pointer-events: none; /* Tooltip itself should not be interactive */
}

/* Style for when the tooltip is made visible by JavaScript */
.mobile-tooltip-custom.visible {
    opacity: 1;
    visibility: visible;
}

/*
   The JavaScript (mobile_tooltips_v2.js) now uses isTouchDevice() to determine
   if these click-based tooltips should be active.
   Therefore, the media query below is less critical for *activating* the styles,
   as the JS handles the activation logic. However, it can still be useful for
   any style adjustments that are *only* desired on smaller viewports,
   even if the device is touch-capable (e.g., a large touch-screen monitor).
   For now, the primary control is via JS detecting touch capability.
*/

/*
   If you still want to restrict these tooltip styles to certain screen sizes
   in addition to touch detection, you can use a media query.
   However, since the JS now activates based on touch, this CSS will apply
   whenever the .mobile-tooltip-custom class is added by the JS on a touch device.

   Example of a media query if you wanted to further refine styles for very small screens:
   @media (max-width: 480px) {
       .mobile-tooltip-custom {
           font-size: 12px;
           padding: 6px 10px;
       }
   }
*/

/*
   Regarding default browser tooltips (title attribute):
   The JS solution uses aria-label. If `title` attributes are still present
   and causing overlapping default tooltips on desktop (non-touch) where
   our custom tooltips are disabled, that's standard browser behavior.
   On touch devices where our script is active, the click interaction for our
   custom tooltip should generally take precedence or not conflict significantly.
   If conflicts arise, specific handling for `title` attributes might be needed,
   but it's often best to rely on `aria-label` for custom tooltips and ensure
   `title` attributes are used appropriately for their default purpose if needed.
